# Plesk Control Panel

Plesk is a powerful commercial WebOps hosting platform that allows you to easily manage and automate web-applications, sites, mailboxes and hosting business. User can customize the operation of online projects, email accounts, and DNS records, etc., using a web interface. Plesk control panel allows you to save a lot of time and effort, since an isolated environment will be created for all your clients, and they will be able to manage their projects independently.
